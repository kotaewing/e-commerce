## Description
This is the backend for an e-commerce api.  It can do a number of functions for three different aspects of the e-commerce store - Products, Tags, and Categories.  For each, it can view all, view one, create one, update one, and delete one.  Since this does not have a front end, I used Insomnia Core to demonstrate each api endpoint.

## Installation
Because this is only the backend, if you would like to see it in action for yourself you will need to install it to your machine.  First, clone the repo to your desired directory.  Next, in the root of the project folder, run `npm i` in order to install the necessary dependencies.  After this, you can run `npm start` to start the server, and then you can test each endpoint by accessing `http://localhost:3001/api/`.

## Usage
In order to use the api endpoints, you will have to use Insomnia Core or Postman.  Visit each api endpoint and send the required data through the body if you are using a post or put request.  To see all of the api's in action and each endpoint, click on the link to YouTube above to see my walkthrough demonstration.
